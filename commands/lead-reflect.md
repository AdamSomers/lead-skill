Periodic reflection: synthesize patterns, surface insights, recalibrate priorities.

Run weekly (e.g., Friday afternoon) or whenever you need to step back and see the bigger picture.

## Steps

1. Read ALL of these:
   - `.lead/context/priorities.md`
   - `.lead/context/principles.md`
   - `.lead/context/team.md`
   - All journal entries from the past 7 days (or since last reflect)
   - All person files in `.lead/people/` (scan for recent entries)
   - Recent decision files in `.lead/decisions/`
   - Check for any previous reflect entries in journal to compare

2. Generate a reflection. Save to `.lead/journal/{YYYY-MM-DD}-reflect.md`:

```markdown
# Reflection — Week of {date range}

## What Happened This Week
{narrative summary of the week's events, not a list — tell the story}

## Priority Scorecard
{for each priority in priorities.md, a brief assessment}
| Priority | Status | Trajectory | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| {name}   | 🟢🟡🔴  | ↑ → ↓      | {brief} |

## Team Pulse (reports)
{for each Type: report, a one-line read on where they are}
| Person | State | Attention Needed |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| {name} | {thriving/steady/struggling/unknown} | {yes/no + why} |

## Relationship Pulse (chain, peers, stakeholders)
{only include people with recent activity in their files or journal mentions}
| Person | Type | Relationship Health | Action Needed |
|--------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| {name} | {chain/peer/stakeholder} | {strong/neutral/needs attention} | {brief} |

## Patterns I'm Noticing
{this is the most important section — what themes are emerging across
journal entries, 1:1s, and decisions? Be specific and cite evidence.}
- {pattern with evidence}
- {pattern with evidence}

## What I'm Underweighting
{based on journal patterns, what am I consistently deprioritizing or
avoiding? What keeps slipping? Be honest and challenging here.}

## Energy Audit
{based on my language in journal entries, where am I spending energy
vs. where should I be spending it?}

## Next Week Focus
1. {highest-leverage thing to focus on and why}
2. {second priority}
3. {third priority}

## Open Questions
{things I should be thinking about but don't have answers for yet}
```

3. After generating, compare to the previous reflection (if one exists).
   Call out:
   - What changed since last time
   - Which patterns are recurring (this is the compound value)
   - Whether my stated focus last week matched what actually happened

4. Ask: "Does this reflection land? Anything you'd adjust in priorities for
   next week?" If I update priorities, write changes to `priorities.md`.

## Next Commands

After reflecting, suggest:
- `/lead-sync` — set focus for next week
- `/clear` — before the next command
