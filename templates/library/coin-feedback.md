# COIN Feedback Method
**Author:** Various (common coaching framework)
**Core idea:** Effective feedback is specific, behavioral, and forward-looking. COIN provides a structure to deliver feedback clearly without triggering defensiveness.

## Key Models

### The COIN Structure
**What it is:** Four-part framework for delivering feedback:
- **C - Context:** When and where did this happen? Set the scene briefly.
- **O - Observation:** What specific behavior did you observe? Facts only, no interpretation.
- **I - Impact:** What was the effect of that behavior? On you, the team, the project.
- **N - Next steps:** What should happen going forward? Request, suggestion, or question.
**When to apply:** Any specific behavioral feedback—positive or constructive.
**Vocabulary:** COIN, context, observation, impact, next steps

### Example: Constructive Feedback
**Context:** "In yesterday's design review..."
**Observation:** "...you interrupted Alex three times while they were presenting."
**Impact:** "This made it harder for the team to follow Alex's reasoning, and I noticed Alex stopped contributing after that."
**Next steps:** "In future reviews, can you hold questions until presenters finish their section?"

### Example: Positive Feedback
**Context:** "During the incident last week..."
**Observation:** "...you took ownership of customer communication without being asked."
**Impact:** "This freed the rest of us to focus on the fix, and customers felt informed throughout."
**Next steps:** "I'd love to see you mentor others on incident communication—would you be up for that?"

## Decision Heuristics
- If feedback feels vague, you're missing the Observation—get more specific about behavior.
- If feedback feels preachy, you're editorializing—stick to observable facts.
- If feedback doesn't land, you may have skipped Impact—people need to understand *why* it matters.
- If nothing changes, your Next steps weren't clear or actionable.
- Use COIN for specific incidents; for broader performance themes, consider a different approach.

## When to Use vs. Not Use COIN
**Use COIN for:**
- Specific behavioral feedback (positive or constructive)
- Incidents you observed directly
- When you want behavior change on something concrete

**Don't force COIN for:**
- Broad performance discussions (use themes and patterns instead)
- Career conversations (more exploratory)
- Feedback on outcomes vs. behaviors (results-based conversations)
- When the person already knows and owns the issue

## Anti-Patterns
- Vague observations: "You were unprofessional" (what specifically?)
- Mind-reading: "You clearly didn't care about the deadline" (stick to behavior)
- Piling on: Multiple unrelated observations in one COIN (one behavior per COIN)
- Delayed feedback: COIN works best close to the event, not months later
- Skipping Next steps: Leaves the person without a path forward
