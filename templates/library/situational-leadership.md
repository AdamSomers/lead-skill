# Situational Leadership
**Author:** Ken Blanchard & Paul Hersey
**Core idea:** There is no single best leadership style. Effective leaders adapt their style to the follower's development level on the specific task.

## Key Models

### Four Leadership Styles
**What it is:** Leadership behavior varies on two dimensions: directive (task) and supportive (relationship). This creates four styles:
- **S1 Directing:** High directive, low supportive. Tell them what, when, how.
- **S2 Coaching:** High directive, high supportive. Explain decisions, solicit input, but still direct.
- **S3 Supporting:** Low directive, high supportive. Facilitate, encourage, share decision-making.
- **S4 Delegating:** Low directive, low supportive. Hand off responsibility, monitor from distance.
**When to apply:** Deciding how to assign and supervise any task.
**Vocabulary:** directing, coaching, supporting, delegating, S1-S4

### Four Development Levels
**What it is:** Followers' readiness varies by competence AND commitment on the specific task:
- **D1 Enthusiastic Beginner:** Low competence, high commitment. Eager but unskilled.
- **D2 Disillusioned Learner:** Some competence, low commitment. Hit the difficulty, lost enthusiasm.
- **D3 Capable but Cautious:** High competence, variable commitment. Can do it, but hesitant.
- **D4 Self-Reliant Achiever:** High competence, high commitment. Owns it fully.
**When to apply:** Assessing where someone is before choosing your leadership style.
**Vocabulary:** D1, D2, D3, D4, development level, competence, commitment

### Style-Development Match
**What it is:** Match leadership style to development level:
- D1 → S1 (Directing)
- D2 → S2 (Coaching)
- D3 → S3 (Supporting)
- D4 → S4 (Delegating)
**When to apply:** Choosing how hands-on to be with a specific person on a specific task.
**Vocabulary:** match, over-supervising, under-supervising

## Decision Heuristics
- If someone is new to a task, start with Directing (S1) even if they're senior—TRM is task-specific.
- If someone hit a wall and lost motivation (D2), increase support AND direction (S2 Coaching).
- If someone is capable but hesitant (D3), reduce direction and provide encouragement (S3 Supporting).
- If someone owns it completely (D4), get out of the way (S4 Delegating)—but stay available.

## Anti-Patterns
- Using the same style for everyone regardless of their development level
- Delegating to a D1 (sets them up to fail)
- Directing a D4 (micromanagement, demotivating)
- Assuming development level is fixed—it varies by task and changes over time
- Confusing seniority with development level on a specific task
