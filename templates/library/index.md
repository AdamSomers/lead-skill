# Leadership Library

## Enabled Frameworks
<!-- Each entry: filename — short description of key models -->
- high-output-mgmt.md — delegation, leverage, task-relevant maturity
- radical-candor.md — feedback, care/challenge quadrant
- situational-leadership.md — directing/coaching/supporting/delegating
- coin-feedback.md — structured feedback delivery (Context, Observation, Impact, Next steps)
- mythical-man-month.md — team scaling, planning, complexity
- pragmatic-programmer.md — technical craft, trade-offs, DRY, orthogonality

## My Preferences
<!-- Edit this section to express personal weighting -->
- Default: ground advice in these frameworks when relevant, don't force it
- For feedback situations, prefer COIN structure
- For delegation/prioritization, lean on Grove's leverage and task-relevant maturity
- For scaling/staffing decisions, lean on Brooks
