# High Output Management
**Author:** Andy Grove
**Core idea:** A manager's output = the output of their organization + the output of neighboring organizations under their influence. Focus on high-leverage activities.

## Key Models

### Managerial Leverage
**What it is:** Your impact is multiplied by how many people or processes you affect. High-leverage activities include: decisions affecting many people, sharing unique knowledge, and removing blockers.
**When to apply:** Prioritizing your time, deciding what meetings to attend, choosing where to intervene.
**Vocabulary:** leverage, multiplier effect, high-leverage activities

### Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)
**What it is:** How directive vs. delegative you should be depends on the person's experience with the *specific task*, not their seniority. Low TRM = be directive. High TRM = delegate.
**When to apply:** Assigning work, deciding how closely to monitor, giving feedback on autonomy.
**Vocabulary:** task-relevant maturity, TRM, directive, delegative

### 1:1s as the Report's Meeting
**What it is:** The 1:1 exists primarily for the report's agenda, not yours. Let them drive topics. Your role is to listen, coach, and remove obstacles.
**When to apply:** Structuring 1:1s, deciding who sets the agenda.
**Vocabulary:** report's meeting, their agenda

### Indicators and Paired Indicators
**What it is:** Any metric you measure will be gamed. Pair indicators to balance incentives (e.g., pair quantity with quality).
**When to apply:** Setting team metrics, reviewing performance, designing OKRs.
**Vocabulary:** indicators, paired indicators, leading/lagging indicators

### Decision-Making Process
**What it is:** Decisions should be made at the lowest competent level. Your job is to ensure the right people are making decisions with the right information.
**When to apply:** Deciding whether to delegate a decision, setting up decision-making structures.
**Vocabulary:** lowest competent level, decision rights

## Decision Heuristics
- If someone is new to a task (even if senior), be more directive until TRM increases.
- If you're spending time on low-leverage activities, find ways to delegate or eliminate them.
- If a metric is being gamed, add a paired indicator to balance incentives.
- If your reports aren't bringing substantive topics to 1:1s, the relationship needs work.

## Anti-Patterns
- Being hands-off with a senior person who has low TRM on a specific task
- Filling 1:1s with your status updates instead of their concerns
- Measuring only one dimension (speed without quality, output without sustainability)
- Making decisions that should be delegated to preserve your leverage for higher-impact work
