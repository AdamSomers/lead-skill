# Radical Candor
**Author:** Kim Scott
**Core idea:** Good management requires both caring personally about your people AND challenging them directly. Most managers fail at one or both.

## Key Models

### The 2x2: Care Personally × Challenge Directly
**What it is:** Two dimensions create four quadrants of feedback behavior. The goal is the upper-right: high care AND high challenge.
**When to apply:** Giving any feedback, evaluating your own management style, coaching other managers.
**Vocabulary:** care personally, challenge directly, radical candor

### The Four Quadrants
**What it is:**
- **Radical Candor** (high care + high challenge): Direct feedback delivered with genuine concern
- **Obnoxious Aggression** (low care + high challenge): Blunt feedback that feels harsh or dismissive
- **Ruinous Empathy** (high care + low challenge): Avoiding hard truths to spare feelings
- **Manipulative Insincerity** (low care + low challenge): Fake nice, passive-aggressive, or political
**When to apply:** Diagnosing why feedback isn't landing, understanding resistance to direct communication.
**Vocabulary:** ruinous empathy, obnoxious aggression, manipulative insincerity

### Praise in Public, Criticize in Private
**What it is:** Praise should be specific and public (when appropriate). Criticism should be private, immediate, and focused on behavior not character.
**When to apply:** Deciding when/where to deliver feedback.
**Vocabulary:** specific praise, private criticism

### Solicit Before You Give
**What it is:** Ask for feedback on yourself before giving feedback to others. This builds trust and models the behavior you want.
**When to apply:** Starting a feedback culture, building trust with a new report.
**Vocabulary:** solicit feedback, model the behavior

## Decision Heuristics
- If feedback feels mean, you're probably missing the "care personally" dimension—show you're invested in their success.
- If you're avoiding a hard conversation, you're in Ruinous Empathy—the short-term comfort creates long-term harm.
- If someone seems defensive to feedback, try soliciting feedback from them first.
- If praise feels empty, make it more specific—what exactly did they do well?

## Anti-Patterns
- Sandwiching criticism between praise (feels manipulative, dilutes both)
- Giving feedback on personality instead of behavior ("you're defensive" vs "when I gave that feedback, you interrupted")
- Waiting for performance reviews to share criticism (should be immediate and ongoing)
- Being direct without demonstrating care (lands as obnoxious aggression)
