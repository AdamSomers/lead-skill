# Management Principles

**Last updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

## My Philosophy
{2-3 sentences on what you believe management is fundamentally about}

## Decision Heuristics
{rules of thumb you use when making decisions — these help Claude calibrate its advice}

- {e.g., "Bias toward reversible decisions — move fast when we can undo it"}
- {e.g., "Staff the critical path first, then spread remaining capacity"}
- {e.g., "When in doubt, talk to the people closest to the problem"}
- {e.g., "Prefer boring technology for infrastructure, experiment at the edges"}

## What I Value in Engineers
- {e.g., "Ownership — they see it, they fix it, they don't wait to be asked"}
- {e.g., "Clear communication — can explain complex things simply"}
- {e.g., "Growth mindset — seeks feedback, iterates, doesn't make the same mistake twice"}

## How I Give Feedback
{your approach to feedback — direct? sandwich method? written first? in the moment?}

## How I Run 1:1s
{your typical structure, frequency, expectations}

## Known Biases to Watch For
{things you know about yourself that might distort your judgment}
- {e.g., "I overweight velocity and underweight code quality"}
- {e.g., "I'm biased toward people who communicate like I do"}
- {e.g., "I tend to avoid hard conversations too long"}

## Career Context
{what you're optimizing for in your own career right now — helps Claude
understand the lens through which you're making decisions}
